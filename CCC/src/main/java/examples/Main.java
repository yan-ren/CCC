	Implementation Details
	All input is from standard input and all output is to standard output. Submitted programs must not read or write to files.
	Output must match the output format specified in the problem exactly. Prompts or
	additional output must not be produced.
	All Java programs must be written in a file called Main.java, and thus have:
	public class Main
	as the classname in that file. Compilation will fail otherwise.

    Example program to demonstrate input and output and time limit.

    Programming Language:  Java

    Specification:

       Write a program that reads several positive integers, one per
       line.  For each integer n, output the number of orderings 
       possible for a set of n distinct values.  n will not exceed 11.
       The last line of input is indicated by 0.

    Sample Input:

       1
       11
       0

    Output for Sample Input:

       1
       39916800

    Implementation:

       The answer is n! (n factorial) which is easily computed in n steps.
       But this program does it the hard way.  It uses a recursive function 
       to enumerate and count all the possible orderings.

    How to run the program:

       The program reads from "standard input" and writes to "standard output."
       Specifically, after compiling (i.e., creating Main.class), you
       can run this program with input by typing at the DOS command prompt
       (yes, you will need a Command Prompt window) in the correct
       directory (where you created the Main.class file):
                 java Main < input.txt
       where input.txt contains the test data.  

    Run-time:

       Please time the execution time of this program on your computer, 
       using the sample input.  This time is the maximum that should be
       allowed for any CCC program.
