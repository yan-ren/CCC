# CCC Junior 2016 Question Analysis
## J1, J2
Simple questions, should be done in very short time. Just be careful for the input reading. J2 may be another smarter way of reading input as a 2D array or even without using 2D array at all.
## J3
Classic question: longest palindrome substring. If you happened to see this question before, you can get mark for free.

Two solutions at least:
1.  DP. This takes runtime O(n^2) and space O(n^2)
2.  Manacher's algorithm. Linear runtime

## J4
Using a speed/distance approach. Convert all time to minutes and convert back in the end.
## J5
Same question as 2016 Senior 2. Sorting and sum. Can use Java Collection for easily sorting.
